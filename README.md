# Audio Dynamic Range Analyser

---
This program takes in an audio file, and calculates and returns a score based on its dynamic range.

Dynamic range calculation is done through the formula given here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range
### WHAT'S DONE:
- Dynamic range calculation
- Score calculation
- GUI (a framework atleast)
- File loading

### TODO:
- Finish the GUI -> Add colours to text, fix padding, etc.
- Persistence (saving scores)
- Waveform grapher to visualise dynamic range

## What is Dynamic Range? Why do we care about it?
In an audio file, dynamic range describes the difference in volume between the loudest parts of a track, and the quietest parts.

Tracks with good dynamic range have a very large difference between the loudest and quietest parts. 
When listening to music, a good difference in volume can make for a good listening experience.
Bigger difference in volume means different instruments may sound louder or quieter, adding depth and making things sound more impactful.

This is an extremely abridged explanation. For more information, I think this video describes dynamic range far better than I can.
